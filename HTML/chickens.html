        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a>, a subspecies of
        the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common
        and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
        as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more
        chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.<sup

        Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
        meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for
        cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food
        until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4]

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
        Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but with the clade found in the
        Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian
        subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to
        Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6]
        Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the
        "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land
        between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose
        III.[7][8][9]

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>
          In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year
          are primarily known as cocks, whereas in the United States, Canada,
          Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called roosters.
          Males less than a year old are cockerels.[10] Castrated or neutered
          roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are now
          illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known
          as hens, and younger females as pullets,[11] although in the
          egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay
          eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age. The young are called chicks. In
          Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a
          generic term chook /tʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes.[12]
          Chicken originally referred to young domestic fowl.[13] The species as
          a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of
          chicken survives in the phrase Hen and Chickens, sometimes used as a
          British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large
          and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and
          Chicken Islands). The hen and chickens was also a name for the
          pentacycle, an early design of cargo cycle which had a large central
          driving wheel surrounded by four small stabiliser wheels. In the Deep
          South of the United States, chickens are referred to by the slang term
          yardbird.[14]
